# led-beat-tracker
An Arduino project to control the animation of strip of leds based on the beat of a sound source

This project was created based on [Damian Pecke Beat Detector code](https://damian.pecke.tt/2015/03/02/beat-detection-on-the-arduino.html) and one of the example projects from the FastLed library to control the WS2811 RGB Led Strip using beat detection.

A small electronic piece must be ensambled to the Arduino to allow the connection of a sound source, and it is based on [Joao Claro's Arduino Beat Detector Project](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Joao_Claro/arduino-beat-detector-d0a21f)
